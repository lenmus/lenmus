<title>Why should you learn about 'intervals'?</title>

<para>
A great step in studying something is understanding its purpose.
</para>

<para>
If you are interested in harmony and composition, you should know that intervals are the building blocks of harmony: you will not be able to understand harmony without studying about intervals.
</para>

<para>
But even if you are not interested on harmony and on theory about music, understanding intervals and being able to quickly and accurately recognize them is vital for reading and singing a score accurately. Also, it is essential for music dictation (writing the music you hear).
</para>

<para>
Therefore, I encourage you to study intervals and do all proposed exercises until you master recognition of intervals, both aurally and on written music.

<title>What is an interval?</title>

<para>
An interval is the distance between two notes, measured as a number. Intervals are named by the number of steps between the two notes. When we measure an interval, we always start counting at the lower note. We then count upwards to the higher note. Consider the following example:
</para>

        (score

                 (na e4 w)
                 (barline end noVisible)
        )))
        </music>
    </score>

<para>
Here, we start counting on the lower note, which is C. We count upwards to the higher note, E. This gives us C, D and E. We counted three notes, so this interval is called a third.
</para>

<para>
If we count four notes, the interval is a fourth, and so on, until we reach eight. If we count eight notes the interval is called an <emphasis>octave</emphasis>.
</para>

</part>

<part>
<title>Melodic and Harmonic Intervals</title>

<para>
We can measure the distance between two notes which are played together at the same time. The distance between these notes is called a 'harmonic' interval. Also we can measure the distance between two notes which are played separately, one after the other. In this case, the distance between these notes is called a 'melodic' interval.
</para>

<para>
Notice that the words 'harmonic' and 'melodic' used to describe intervals has nothing to do with its meaning when we use them to talk about harmonic and melodic minor scales.

<para>
Melodic intervals are read horizontally and are found in melodies, whereas harmonic intervals are read vertically, and are found in chords. But, in any case, they are measured and named in the same way.
</para>

<part>
<title>Interval Numbers</title>

<para>
To find the number of an interval, first find the note names of the two notes, (ignore any sharps and flats for now), and count the letter names, starting with the lower note on the stave, (it could be the first or second note along on the stave if it is a melodic interval).
</para>

<para>
The smallest interval we can consider is the interval between two identical notes - e.g. E and E. This interval is called a 'unison'. We can also say that the notes are 'in unison'.
</para>

<para>
The following score shows some examples of intervals within one octave:

<title>Starting on the higher note: a very common mistake!</title>

<para>
What happens if you try to calculate an interval by starting with the higher note on the stave? You will get the wrong answer! This is a common mistake, so let's look at an example of what can go wrong. What is the following harmonic interval?
</para>

                 (barline end noVisible)
        )))
        </music>
    </score>

<para>
First, the correct way: starting on the lower note (C), we count letter names to the higher note, (G), C-D-E-F-G =5, which gives us a 5th. This is the right answer!
</para>

<para>
Now the wrong way. Starting on the first note (G), we count the letter names to the second note (C), G-A-B-C =4, which gives us a 4th. This is the wrong answer!

<title>Writing Intervals</title>

<para>
There are two important steps to follow when you write intervals.
</para>

<para>
First, you need to work out which notes you have to write, and secondly you need to write the notes clearly and accurately.
</para>

<para>
If you have to write an interval, you will be given the first (lower) note of the two, and you will be told what interval to calculate; something like this:

<para>
You'll also be told if you have to write a harmonic, or melodic interval. This one is a melodic interval, so we'll write the second note after the given note.
</para>

<para>
Remember that we start counting on the lower note, which is F in our example. We've been told to write a 7th, so we count seven notes upwards: F, G, A, B flat, C, D, E. The seventh note is E, so that's the note we need to write.
</para>

<para>
Don't forget that we were told to write a melodic interval, so in this case we will write the E after the F, and not directly above it:

Don't forget to look carefully at the clef, to place the note in the right line or space!.

<para>
One interval is a bit more awkward to write than the others, and that is the harmonic 2nd. Harmonic intervals are written directly above the given note, but the 2nd is too close to write directly, so we have to move it to the side a little. If you try to write it directly above, you will produce something unreadable like this:
