description: wxMidi is a MIDI interface based on PortMidi, the Portable 
Real-Time MIDI Library. wxMidi offers a set of classes (wxMidiSystem, 
wxMidiDevice, wxMidiMessage, wxMidiDatabaseGM and derived from them) that 
interfaces wxWidgets with the PortMidi library. With this component you can add
MIDI in/out commands support to your wxWidgets application. wxMidi provides a 
suitable interface, object oriented, to use portmidi with wxWidgets, and all 
strings has been moved from PortMidi and adapted to support 
internationalization.
