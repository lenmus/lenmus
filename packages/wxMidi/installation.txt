 wxMidi component info
 ======================
 
 Component:  wxMidi
 Release:    1.1
 Date:       03-Jan-2006
 wxWidgets:  2.4.x, 2.5.x, 2.6.x
 Maintainer: Cecilio Salmeron  /  s.cecilio@gmail.com
   
 Description:
    wxMidi is a MIDI interface based on PortMidi, the Portable Real-Time MIDI Library, 
    (PortMidi is available at: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~music/portmidi/).
 
    wxMidi offers a set of classes: wxMidiSystem, wxMidiDevice, wxMidiMessage, 
    wxMidiDatabaseGM and derived from them, that interfaces wxWidgets with the PortMidi
    library. With this component you can add MIDI in/out support to your wxWidgets
    application.

    The main differences with PortMidi are:

    - wxMidi provides a suitable interface, object oriented, to use portmidi with wxWidgets.
 
    - All strings has been moved from PortMidi and adapted to support internationalization.
 
    - SysEx messages are not received in chunks with real-time messages interleaved. In wxMidi,
        sysex messages are received completed, in a single string of bytes, and any
        real-time message embeded is delivered before the sysex message is delivered.
 
    - All buffer allocation process for messages is now hiden in the wxMidi clases. User has
        not to worry abut this.

    - wxMidi also includes an additional feature, class wxMidiDatabaseGM, which provides methods
        for dealing with the General MIDI Standard (GM) instruments list. 


    By now, these classes wrap only the most important PortMidi features but they are
    perfectly integrated with wxWidgets and easily extensible since they provide good
    commented code and documentation.

    wxMidi has been tested only in Windows.

 wxMidi 1.x Installation
 ========================
 
wxMidi has been developed and tested in Windows. Makefiles included in this distribution are only
for MS Visual Studio 2003 .NET.  Sorry, but I do not have equipment/knowledge to give
support for other compilers/platforms. Any help with this will be appreciated.


 =============================================================================
 Step 1: INSTALL PORTMIDI    (For windows is already done. You can skip this step)

   Be aware that the current version of PortMidi (17/nov/04) produces systematically
   a memory leak. The problem is not serious as the memory leak refers to some small
   fixed blocks of memory (about 20-40 bytes, one block per MIDI device in your machine)
   allocated on initialization that are not released at termination of the portmidi package.
   The problem IS FIXED in the PortMidi package included with wxMidi and the patch
   has been reported to PortMidi maintainers.
   But take this into account if you decide to download the PortMidi package and install
   it instead of using the precompiled package included with wxMidi.
 =============================================================================


1)  For your convenience, the portmidi package is included in this download so it is not
    necessary to do download it. In case the portmidi package were not included or you
    would like to install an updated version, download portmidi.zip and 
    unzip it into directory: wxMidi\src\portmidi

2)  Compile package following the instructions in the package. Do not change
    the character set from Multibyte to Unicode. You will set this later in the
    wxMidi package.
    PORTMIDI MUST BE BUILT IN MULTIBYTE MODE, AND YOU MUST ENSURE THAT CONSTANT
    PM_CHECK_ERRORS IS NOT DEFINED IN THE PORTMIDI PROJECT (check that this definition
    is not included by in the predefined symbols list in the Settings dialog box).
    For Unicode versions, wxMidi takes care of converting portmidi strings to
    Unicode, so it is not necesary to build a Unicode version of portmidi libraries.

3)  After successful compilation, copy the libraries to the appropiate folder (\pm folder
    for release version, \pmd folder for debug version) in wxMidi\lib:

        wxMidi\src\portmidi\pm_win\Release\pm_dll.dll    -->  wxMidi\lib\pm\pm_dll.dll
        wxMidi\src\portmidi\pm_win\Release\portmidi.lib  -->  wxMidi\lib\pm\portmidi.lib
        wxMidi\src\portmidi\pm_win\Release\porttime.lib  -->  wxMidi\lib\pm\porttime.lib

        wxMidi\src\portmidi\pm_win\Debug\pm_dll.dll    -->  wxMidi\lib\pmd\pm_dll.dll
        wxMidi\src\portmidi\pm_win\Debug\portmidi.lib  -->  wxMidi\lib\pmd\portmidi.lib
        wxMidi\src\portmidi\pm_win\Debug\porttime.lib  -->  wxMidi\lib\pmd\porttime.lib

4)  Copy include file  portmidi\pm_common\portmidi.h  to  wxMidi\include


 =============================================================================
 Setp 2: COMPILE wxMidi    (For windows is already done. You can skip this step)
 =============================================================================

1)  Compile wxMidi. All makefiles and project are located in build\msw directory.
    After successful compilation you'll find the library in the subdirectory wxMidi\lib. 
    Name of the compiled library follow this scheme: name begin with "wxmidi" followed by
    version number and letters indicating if the library is compiled as Unicode ('u') 
    and/or debug build ('d'). Here are some examples:

          lib\wxmidi10.lib  release library
          lib\wxmidi10u.lib release Unicode library
          lib\wxmidi10d.lib Debug library
          lib\wxmidi10ud.lib    Debug Unicode library


2)  IMPORTANT! In Windows, portmidi needs the pm_dll.dll, but there is no simple way
    to set up projects to use this dll. Therefore, YOU MUST COPY this dll to your
    application executable file folder.



 =============================================================================
 Setp 3: COMPILE midisound SAMPLE TEST APPLICATION
 =============================================================================

For now, only project file for MS VC .NET 2003 !!

1)  Open project file in wxMidi\build\msw\midisound.sln  and build it.

2)  Copy pm_dll.dll from wxMidi\lib\pmd\pm_dll.dll to the application.exe folder.

3)  Run it. Good luck and enjoy!




 Known bugs and problems
 ========================

    None.
