===============================================

This document is a quick guide to install the Midi synthesizer TIMidity++ in Ubuntu 8.04.

THIS GUIDE ARE JUST MY NOTES FOR DOING IT. This notes should be enough in most cases. Please refer to your Linux distro documentation, for more detailed instructions.

Install TiMidity (MIDI player/software synthesizer)
---------------------------------------------------------


1. Install Timidity++
------------------------

To install MIDI support on Ubuntu, enable universe repositories and install package timidity using Synaptic. Alternatively, run the following command:

sudo apt-get install timidity


2. Install high quality sound patches
--------------------------------------

Next you need a set of instrument sound patches. The easiest way is to install package 'freepats' (a 28 MB download). that is a basic set of sounds. But if you want better quality sounds, I recommend to install high quality sound patches, such as the package 'eawpatches' (a 31 MB download).

So, choose:

a) 'freepats' sounds:

'freepats' sounds are in the same repository than Timidity (It is istalled with Timidity. Check this and install if not)

sudo apt-get install freepats


b) 'eawpatches' sounds:

Add the following repository line to your sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list file:

deb http://www.fbriere.net/debian/dists/etch misc/

And install the package 'eawpatches' using Synaptic. Alternatively, if you don't want to add this repository, you may download the package here from http://www.fbriere.net/debian/dists/etch/misc/deb/

Once you have installed the 'eawpatches' sounds package, you have to configure Timidity to use it. Edit file '/etc/timidity/timidity.cfg':

sudo gedit /etc/timidity/timidity.cfg

And change the following line:

      source /etc/timidity/freepats.cfg

to:

      source /etc/timidity/eawpatches.cfg


3. Test timidity
------------------

And now, you're ready to listen to some midi files. If you need a MIDI file to test this with, here's a short one: http://www.webpost.net/av/avatarmaster/patricksworld.mid

To play the file:

    timidity testfile.mid


4. Now, install Timidity as a server
---------------------------------------------------------

Issue the following commands: You may not need all these (I found it worked with just the first two).

sudo modprobe snd-seq-device
sudo modprobe snd-seq-midi
sudo modprobe snd-seq-oss
sudo modprobe snd-seq-midi-event
sudo modprobe snd-seq

This loads missing modules. Then enter:

timidity -iA -B2,8 -Os1l -s 44100

This loads TiMidity++ as a midi server and opens 2 midi ports, 128:0 and 128:1. After issuing it, you should have midi players working. 

Test this with LenMus. Open LenMus MidiWizard, select device 'TiMidity port 0' and click 'Next'. In the next wizard window click 'Test sound'. You should hera the test sound.

To close TiMidity++, press CTRL-C in the terminal it's running in.


5. Automatically starting TiMidity server on boot
----------------------------------------------------

To use LenMus it is better to install timidity as a server at boot time instead of having to do it manually each time it is needed.

Ubuntu sets up scripts in /etc/init.d when you install TiMidity++. To start it on boot, edit /etc/default/timidity and uncomment the line

TIM_ALSASEQ=true

You'll also need to add the modules you loaded earlier. To do this, issue this command at the terminal:

    sudo gedit /etc/modules 

When prompted, enter your password. Now, at the end of the file, add this:

    snd-seq
    snd-seq-device
    snd-seq-midi
    snd-seq-oss
    snd-seq-midi-event

And that's all. Timidity will start as server at boot time. And LenMus will produce sounds.


6. (optional) Reduce Timidity++'s CPU usage:
---------------------------------------------
If TiMidity++ uses too much CPU on your slow machine, try adding these lines to the start of /etc/timidity/timidity.cfg


sudo gedit /etc/timidity/timidity.cfg

Add:

opt EFresamp=l          #use linear resampling
opt EFvlpf=d            #disable VLPF
opt EFreverb=d          #disable reverb
opt EFchorus=d          #disable chorus
opt EFdelay=d           #disable delay

Save and close the file.
